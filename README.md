# Course Review
I highly recommend this course for anyone currently or about to be working with React!!!!

I had already been developing for 2 years with React/Typescript at LeftLane Software Inc. on a RedwoodJS application when I decided to try out this course.

My goal was to test this course out to see if it was worth suggesting to others (like my team), but also to fill in some holes I might have missed from self-teaching myself.
 
The course was great, very easy to self pace (in my case 2x speed on the videos and quick setup time for the excersizes), and it did in fact fill in some gaps in my knowledge that were immediately applicable in my own work!
